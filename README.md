- 👋 Hi, I’m @moonstruckmidnight! You can call me Rattles, since that's kind of a mouthful, I know.
- 👀 I’m interested in game design! I'm... very much a newbie to all of this, but code seems pretty expansiveand versatile, so hopefully once I know more I can update this to be more specific to my interests - can't list what I don't know yet, right?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning game design! I will hopefully be working on a text-based game soon, as soon as I, you know. Figure out how to make one.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... nothing currently!
- 📫 How to reach me? Politely, no <3
